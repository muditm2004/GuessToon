      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Guess Toon</strong>—the ultimate cartoon guessing
        game where your knowledge of animated characters is put to the test!
        Ready to stretch those memory muscles and test your toon knowledge?
        Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Silhouettes Galore:</strong> You’ll be presented with a
          silhouette of a beloved cartoon character. Your job? Guess who it is!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hints? Sure… but at a cost:</strong> Need a little help? You
          can use a hint, but be warned: using a hint will reduce your score for
          that particular guess!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Score Big:</strong> The faster you guess, the higher your
          score. No need to rush, though—take your time and think it through, or
          use a hint if you're stuck!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
